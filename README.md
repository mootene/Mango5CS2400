Mango5CS2400
------------
Implementation of CS2400 Project 5 includes GraphInterface.java and Vertex.java interface and class files. 
Both Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix Graph Implementation classes are included in src/main/java and tested in successive parametrized 
unit test methods in src/test/java/GraphTest.java
Both class files contain implementations and depth and breadth first traversal methods \

main method located in src/test/java/GraphTest.java and will output traversals of given graph by both graph classes to terminal.
to run unit tests/ check for buid failures utilize "mvn test" and "mvn compile" on command line.
(All files can be seen passing tests and build success shown in screen recording) \
